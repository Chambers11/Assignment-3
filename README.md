### Feature 1

In this branch, the ForestFire3D script contains code for real time player positing on the Mini Map.The functionality of this feature is that it allows you, via a 2D map, to identify you position in relation to the  Virtual Reality World. A practical application of this feature is that it allows people in the VR World to see where the  safest areas are on the map are, or where the most dangerous  areas on the map are and how best they can avoid coming in contact with the flames. The feature uses C# code to update continuously the players position and reflect/ display it on the Mini Map in the form of a blue sprite as indicated in figure1.

The color scheme in the Mini Map represents the prefabrications in the VR-World, as well as the people . The deep blue sprite (squares) indicates the persons/players position in the map . The red sprite indicate the fire that is burning throughout the VR World, the green spites  reflects the trees, yellow sprites reflect the grass, grey sprites reflect the rocks and black sprites signify burnt trees and grass.
