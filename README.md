## Feature 2
The second feature coded was added to this branch off the main body of code, the feature was wind, the wind was simulated using a random number generator between the values of 1 and 8. The numbers symbolize cardinal directions  1 being North and 8 being North West. The functionality of the wind is to simulate real a real world forest fire which would be exposed to wind blowing in different directions. Such a functionality can prove vital in helping rescue teams understand how best to extinguish such fires, or it can help in identifying the likely trajectory of the fire and allow for early evacuation of nearby  towns and cities.
